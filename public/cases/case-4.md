## Physician Note
Patient Information:
Name: Jordan Lee
Age: 41
Gender: Female

--- 

Diagnosis:
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), risk of euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) due to SGLT2 inhibitor 

History/Chief Complaint:
Patient is interested in managing her T2D with a very low carbohydrate diet for which she is contraindicated due to her risk of euglycemic DKA. Patient also has instances of dehydration due to infrequent hydration.

Past Medical History:
Patient was diagnosed with T2D three years ago and has been on medication since. Patient also has a history of dehydration.

Surgical History:
None reported.

Family History:
Patient’s father has a history of T2D favouring the possibility of a genetic predisposition.

Social History:
Patient does not smoke or consume alcohol. She exercises moderately and is attempting to lose weight.

Medications:
SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and metformin.

Allergies: 
No known drug allergies.

Physical Examination:
Within normal limits.

Assessment:
Patient's HbA1c is elevated, indicating that her blood sugar levels are not well-controlled. She has a risk for euglycemic DKA being on SGLT2 inhibitor, and thus should avoid very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets. Reiterated the importance of maintaining proper hydration to avoid dehydration-related complications.

Plan:
1. Continued close monitoring of the patient's blood glucose levels with readjustment of medication dosages as needed.
2. Counseled on the risks of a very low carbohydrate diet on her current medication regimen. Suggested nutrition consultation for a customized diet plan that is safe and suitable for her.
3. Encourage hydration and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle including regular exercise.
4. Review patient in 3 months or earlier if she experiences symptoms of unusually high or low sugar levels, sudden weight loss, or fallen sick due to dehydration.

## Nutritionist Note
Patient Name: Jordan Lee

Mr/Ms. Lee presents with Type 2 Diabetes and is currently being treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and Metformin. Given their medication regimen, Ms. Lee should abstain from very low-carb and keto diets to minimize the risk of euglycemic Diabetic ketoacidosis.

Dietary Recommendations: 
Given her interest in weight loss and improvement in her A1c levels, Ms. Lee's energy intake will be structured to promote gradual weight loss (~0.5-1 kg/week or 1-2 lb/week). Her diet should be well balanced and comprise complex carbohydrates (~45-60% of total energy intake), lean proteins (~15-20% of total energy intake), and healthy fats (~20-35% of total energy intake), distributed evenly throughout the day (three main meals and 2-3 snacks).

Physical Activity and Lifestyle Recommendations: 
I would strongly recommend regular physical activity, ideally 150 minutes spread out through the week. This can include walking, swimming or any other form of aerobic exercise which she enjoys and can maintain consistently. Strength training exercises twice a week would also be beneficial.

I would also stress the importance of keeping hydrated, especially so due to her past history of dehydration. Smaller and frequent intakes of fluid can be deployed to overcome forgetfulness. Single-use water bottles or reminder apps may be useful for this purpose.

Goals and Outcomes:
The primary goal would be improvement in glycemic control and weight management. This can be monitored through regular HbA1c tests and weight measurements. Secondary outcomes would include improvement in lipid profile, blood pressure and overall well-being.

Monitor regularly to ensure that dietary interventions and lifestyle modifications are effective and sustainable. Continuous patient education will aid in consistent dietary practices and facilitate treatment compliance.

Education: 
Considering the potential risks associated with her medications, it will be important to educate Ms. Lee about the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, including dry mouth, frequent urination, nausea, breath that smells fruity, and persistent feeling of tiredness, and instructing her on what to do should any of these occur.

Please arrange for follow-up consultations in order to continually assess and adjust diet and lifestyle modifications as required.

This provides a comprehensive and sustainable approach to managing her diabetes via diet and lifestyle modifications, in tandem with her current medical treatment regimen. It is important to reiterate that these recommendations should be used to complement her ongoing treatments and not to replace them. Ms. Lee should also consult her doctor before making any changes in the medication regime.

## Social Worker Note
Subject: Social Support and Resource Recommendations for Jordan Lee

I had a consultation with the patient, Jordan Lee, a 41-year-old diabetic woman with a history of dehydration due to forgetfulness as reported by the patient herself. She is currently on an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and metformin to manage her Type 2 diabetes. She expressed interest in adopting a very low carb diet (<50g carbs/day) for weight loss and improving her A1c. However, considering her current prescription regime, this diet plan poses a contraindication due to the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. 

Social support plays a vital role in engaging patients in their healthcare plans and maintaining their emotional wellbeing. Therefore, I have recommended a few community resources, counseling options, and financial strategies to support Jordan in her journey:

1. Community Resources: Local diabetes support groups like the American Diabetes Association Community can offer Jordan invaluable peer support, exchange of practical tips and shared experiences, as well as opportunities for group exercises. The local YMCA/YWCA or adult community centers also offer fitness programs and healthy eating workshops adapted to the needs of diabetic individuals. I have provided Jordan with their addresses and meeting schedules.

2. Counseling: Given the demands of managing a chronic illness like diabetes, psychological support can be instrumental. I recommended Jordan to see a therapist or social worker specializing in chronic illness to manage any possible stress or depression. There are also registered dietitians who can guide her transition to a healthier diet while considering her condition and medication. 

3. Financial and Social Barriers: Due to potential financial challenges for some patients, there are services like NeedyMeds and Prescription Assistance which offer help in covering medication costs. In terms of social barriers, case management services and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging can provide home aid, transportation, or meal services. 

Moving forward, we plan to continue monitoring Jordan's progress and provide assistance as needed. Furthermore, an evaluation for care navigation services is recommended given her history of forgetfulness concerning hydration, which could potentially lead to serious complications. 

We believe these comprehensive strategies will help Jordan effectively manage her diabetes while improving her overall quality of life. We will reassess her status and adapt her support plan accordingly in future consultations.

## Pharmacist Note
Patient Name: Jordan Lee

Clinical Medication Management Note:

During today's consultation, I reviewed Ms. Lee's current medication regimen, consisting of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, and metformin for her type 2 diabetes. 

From the medication review, it was noted that the empagliflozin could increase her risk of developing euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition if not treated early. Evidence shows that this risk can be elevated in those on a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets. Given her interest in a low carbohydrate diet (<50g/day) for weight loss and improving her A1c, it would not be advisable for Ms. Lee to pursue this dietary approach due to the elevated risk of euglycemic DKA.

In addition, Ms. Lee also has a history of recurrent dehydration due to reported forgetfulness. This can further raise her risk of euglycemic DKA, as this condition can exacerbate during periods of fluid depletion. 

Regarding her medication adherence, Ms. Lee currently reports no issues with taking her medications as prescribed. She has been compliant with her medication regimen with no reported missed doses.

However, it is strongly recommended for Ms. Lee to maintain adequate hydration and be vigilant for the symptoms of DKA, which may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing, fruity odor on breath, and alterations in consciousness. In case of these symptoms presenting, urgent medical attention should be sought. 

It is crucial for Ms. Lee to have regular reviews of her medication needs, diet, and hydration status to continue managing her diabetes optimally and to prevent potential medication-related issues. 

In conclusion, my recommendations include continuing her current medication regimen, abstaining from a very low carb or keto diet due to the increased risk of euglycemic DKA, and diligent maintenance of hydration. Regular follow up visits are also suggested for continued medication review and management.

Please note: The above lab results indicate that the patient's diabetes is not well-controlled and her lipid profile is sub-optimal. The patient should continue to take her current medications and may need dose adjustments. She should be discouraged from starting a very low carb diet due to the increased risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with her SGLT2 inhibitor use. Proper hydration strategies should be reemphasized to prevent possible dehydration. For weight loss advice and better control of her diabetes and cholesterol levels, diet counselling could be advised.
