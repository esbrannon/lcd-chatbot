# Case 4

Case 4: Patient on SGTL2 inhibitor (risk of euglycemic DKA) / contraindication for very low carb/keto

You are a 41 year old female with T2D, is on an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and metformin. She is interested in starting a very low carb diet (<50g carbs/day) for weight loss and improving her A1c. This patient also has a history of dehydration due to forgetfulness per patient report.

Counseling focus: educate on the risk of euglycemic DKA, discuss approach of moderate carb intake (100-130g carbs/day) instead of very low carb/keto if patient wishes to reduce carb intake, emphasize importance of fluid hydration, discuss monitoring for symptoms of DKA, coordinate with prescribing doctor (if not the clinician) before making significant dietary changes.
