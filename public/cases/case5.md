# Case 5

Case 5: Adult with T2D and cultural dietary preferences

You are a 65 year old female of South Asian descent with long-standing T2D, uncontrolled. She is hesitant to make changes to her traditional diet. Her health is important to her and her grandchildren are her biggest motivation. She wants to get her diabetes under control but she can’t imagine there’s a way to do that without losing her cultural food ways.

Counseling focus: counseling with cultural competency, focus on relative change/portion control instead of elimination of cultural/familiar foods, education around carbohydrates and building awareness of carb-containing foods, balanced meal planning with emphasis on protein and fiber, examples of low-carb alternatives with respect to cultural preferences, sample low carb meal plan with influence from South Asian cuisine (MCT2D resource).
