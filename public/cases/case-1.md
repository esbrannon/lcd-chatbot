Subject: Initial Dietary Consultation

Alex Smith, a 46-year-old male newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), presents with A1c levels above the target goal. He is currently not on any glucose-lowering medications. Mr. Smith expresses feelings of overwhelm and resistance related to the necessary lifestyle change coming with this new diagnosis. He also expresses concerns about meal preparation and the potential need for medications.

Dietary Recommendations:

Considering Mr. Smith's current BMI indicating overweight/obesity it is critical to initiate a tailored nutritional approach designed to promote weight loss, improve blood glucose control, and reduce the risk of comorbidities. 

1. Encourage a nutrient-dense, balanced diet: Aim for a mix of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats to achieve blood sugar control and weight loss. 

2. Portion control: Encourage appropriate portion sizes as a vital strategy for weight management. 

3. Limit the intake of processed, high sugar foods, and sugary beverages: These foods can cause quick and significant blood sugar spikes.

Macronutrient Intake Goals:

1. Carbohydrates: Approximately 45-60% of daily calorie intake. Emphasize complex carbohydrates over simple sugars for better glycemic control.

2. Protein: Approximately 20% of daily calorie intake. Lean options like chicken, eggs, fish, and legumes would be preferable.

3. Fats: Approximately 20-35% of daily calorie intake, but limit saturated fat to less than 10% of total calories. Favor unsaturated fats such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and fish.

Lifestyle Modifications:

1. Regular physical activity: Recommend at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.

2. Monitor blood glucose levels: Empower Mr. Smith to track his blood glucose levels regularly to understand how different foods, activities, and stress influence his blood sugar.

3. Stress management: Encourage methods like meditation or yoga which may help him manage his feelings of distress and overwhelm.

4. Regular follow-ups and support: Schedule regular consultations to track progress, address concerns, and adjust goals or strategies as needed to support gradual and sustained lifestyle changes.

Despite his initial resistance, it is crucial for Mr. Smith to understand that these modifications, in combination with regular medical oversight, can significantly enhance his quality of life, manage his T2D, and reduce the risk of complications.

Alex Smith, a 46-year-old male patient recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, presents with multiple concerns primarily associated with emotional distress regarding lifestyle changes, dietary management, and possible medication initiation. Mr. Smith is currently not on any glucose-lowering medications. His recent A1c test indicates levels above the target goal, suggestive of sub-optimal glycemic control. 

Given the recent diagnosis, feeling overwhelmed and resistant to change is not uncommon. Mr. Smith's emotional experiences need to be identified and addressed appropriately to promote coping strategies and encourage lifestyle modifications and self-monitoring of diabetes. 

Following consultation, it is advisable that Mr. Smith consider attending a multidisciplinary Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) program. These programs offer comprehensive education and guidance on meal planning, physical activity, monitoring blood glucose and other essential aspects of diabetes care. We have identified local DSMES programs available in our community that offer need-based financial assistance candidates.

Furthermore, in order to address Mr. Smith's emotional distress, referrals to both individual and group counseling options are recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also an effective strategy to manage diabetes distress and has proven to help patients with diabetes manage their feelings and reduce distress. There are CBT therapists available locally, some of whom provide therapy on a sliding-scale fee structure.

Group support can also be beneficial for Mr. Smith. Several diabetes support groups meet in the local area, for instance, the Diabetes Support Network, and these can offer both practical advice and emotional support to newly diagnosed patients.

In addition to this, online resources and communities such as Diabetes.co.uk, the American Diabetes Association online community, and the Diabetes Sisters- online support for women might prove helpful to reduce feelings of isolation and distress. 

Finally, it must be considered that Mr. Smith's resistance may stem from financial concerns. Potential resources might include the American Diabetes Association’s prescription assistance program. In the availability of these resources, it is hoped that Mr. Smith will feel more equipped and supported to manage his new diagnosis and make the necessary lifestyle changes.

Will follow up with Mr. Smith on the uptake of these resources and continues feelings of distress, and provide interventional support as needed.

Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes

Pharmacist Clinical Note:

04/18/2023

Upon evaluation today, Mr. Smith, a recently diagnosed 46-year-old T2D patient, presents with a heightened level of distress and an unwillingness to implement necessary lifestyle changes. He does not have any glucose-lowering medication prescribed as per the records reviewed. 

Assessment:

Mr. Smith’s A1c levels are above target goal, suggesting a necessity for improved glycemic control. His reluctance towards change, fear of medications and of the mental toll of dealing with a chronic illness like diabetes poses a challenge to effective diabetes management. 

Plan:

Lifestyle modifications remain an essential part of T2D management to reduce A1c levels. It includes measures such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and reducing stress. Considering the immense distress and resistance towards change, it is recommended that Mr. Smith be considered for a referral to receive psychological support. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be beneficial in addressing his concerns and facilitating effective management of his T2D.

Medication Adherence:

Mr. Smith is currently not on any glucose-lowering medications as per the recent diagnosis and his resistance towards initiation of pharmacotherapy. If any medications are prescribed in the future, his adherence will be monitored during follow-up appointments. Reminder systems may be suggested to support medication adherence.

Counseling points:

Should glucose-lowering medication become a part of his treatment regime, it is important to reassure Mr. Smith that these medications are aimed at improving his health by maintaining his blood glucose levels. It is important to explain the potential benefits and common side effects of these medications so he can fully understand their purpose and recognize any adverse events. Also, reinforcing the importance of adherence to prescribed medication to achieve optimum glycemic control is crucial. 

Follow-Up:

A follow-up is recommended in 1 month with a multidisciplinary team that includes a dietitian and psychologist to help Mr. Smith gain a comprehensive understanding of managing his T2D more effectively. Regular pharmacy follow-ups and medication reviews will also be scheduled to assure adherence and management of potential side effects from any prescribed medication.
