A 35-year-old male truck driver with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has recently experienced a jump in his A1c levels from 7.2% to 8.5%. He expresses a desire to improve his health and halt the progression of his diabetes through changes in his lifestyle, rather than medication. The patient's diet, currently high in carbohydrates from fast food and sugary drinks due to his job on the road, is targeted for change, but he needs guidance on how to implement a healthier, low-carb diet.
