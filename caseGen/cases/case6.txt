Patient with prediabetes and low health literacy

32 year old female with borderline T2D (most recent A1c 6.3%). She is a single parent with 3 young kids, working 2 jobs to make ends meet and receiving food stamp assistance. Her kids mean everything to her and she always prioritizes her kids before herself. As a result, there is often a heavy reliance on fast food and packaged meals. She states that she does not know why her blood sugar spikes even though she only eats one meal a day. She feels guilty but states that she does not have time to eat healthy foods or prepare healthy meals, fruits and vegetables are too expensive.
